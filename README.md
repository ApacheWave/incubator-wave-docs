Apache Wave Documentation
--------------------------
The Apache Wave project is a stand alone wave server and rich web client
that serves as a Wave reference implementation.
Apache Wave site: http://incubator.apache.org/wave/
This project lets developers and enterprise users run wave servers and
host waves on their own hardware. And then share those waves with other
wave servers.

Here you will find (eventually) all the documentation on building, installing,
running, managing and contributing to Apache Wave.

In the meantime, please continue to use the existing documentation that can be
found on our [website](http://incubator.apache.org/wave), in the [wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WAVE/Home),
and at [Wave Protocol (old website)](http://www.waveprotocol.org).
